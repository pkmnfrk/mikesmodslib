# Mike's Mods Lib

This is a common library for mods made by Mike (aka, pkmnfrk). It provides the following features:

* A full GUI control library
* Useful pre-made network packets
* Base classes for Items, Blocks and Fluids
* Recipe helpers
* Various helper functions
* Some other random stuff that is useful

Note: In spite of this, I would exercise caution before taking a dependency on this mod. In particular, things may change arbitrarily and without warning!
